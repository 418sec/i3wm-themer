# Themes

My collection of themes for i3. 

# What you might need

- i3-wm in any Linux distro you prefer
- Polybar (for most of the themes)
- You might need to copy the files located in "scripts" folder into "~/.config/polybar/"
  to make the Polybar configuration work properly on most themes.
- To recreate some of the GTK themes (for now) you can download <a href="https://github.com/actionless/oomox">oomox</a> and use the 
  colors located in "/{Theme_name}/.resources/.extend.Xresources" and recreate them.
- A couple of fonts might be required. <a href="https://github.com/chrissimpkins/Hack">Hack Font</a> and <a href="http://fontawesome.io/">Font Awesome</a>.

# How to install 

(For now) Just copy every file to the right place. (I will add more instructions later) 

(Feature) I will probably upload my own script to apply the themes in an automated way.
